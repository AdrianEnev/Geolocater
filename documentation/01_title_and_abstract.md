# InfraLock: A High-Performance IP Intelligence and Threat Detection System

## Abstract

InfraLock is a sophisticated IP intelligence system designed to provide high-performance geolocation and threat detection capabilities. The system combines a Node.js-based web API with a high-performance Rust microservice to deliver sub-millisecond IP lookups with comprehensive threat assessment. This research project demonstrates how modern systems programming techniques and careful architecture can be leveraged to create a robust, scalable solution for IP-based intelligence.

Current implementation focuses on IP-based analysis, including geolocation, VPN detection, proxy identification, and TOR exit node recognition. The system is built with extensibility in mind, laying the groundwork for future enhancements in user behavior analysis through fingerprinting and other advanced techniques.

## Key Features

- **High-Performance Lookups**: Achieves sub-millisecond response times for IP lookups
- **Comprehensive Threat Detection**: Identifies VPNs, proxies, and TOR exit nodes with high accuracy
- **Scalable Architecture**: Distributed design allows for horizontal scaling to handle high query volumes
- **Extensible Framework**: Modular design supports easy addition of new detection methods and data sources

## Future Directions

While the current implementation focuses on IP-based analysis, the architecture is designed to support more sophisticated user behavior analysis in the future, including:

- Browser fingerprinting for enhanced user identification
- Behavioral analysis for anomaly detection
- Machine learning models for improved threat classification
- Integration with additional threat intelligence feeds
