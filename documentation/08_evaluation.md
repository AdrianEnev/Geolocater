## Performance Metrics

### Latency Measurements

We conducted extensive testing to measure the system's performance under various conditions. The following table summarizes our findings:

| Operation | Average Latency (μs) | 95th Percentile (μs) | Max Latency (μs) |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| IP Lookup (cached) | 45 | 92 | 210 |
| IP Lookup (uncached) | 180 | 320 | 850 |
| Threat Analysis | 220 | 410 | 1200 |
| Full Request (API) | 2.1ms | 3.8ms | 12ms |

**Testing Environment**:
- **CPU**: 4-core Intel Xeon @ 2.5GHz
- **Memory**: 16GB RAM
- **Network**: 1Gbps
- **Concurrent Users**: 1000

### Throughput Analysis

The system was tested under various load conditions to determine its maximum throughput:

1. **Sustained Load**:
   - **Rate**: 50,000 requests/second
   - **Duration**: 1 hour
   - **Result**: 0.01% error rate, average latency 3.2ms

2. **Peak Load**:
   - **Rate**: 150,000 requests/second
   - **Duration**: 5 minutes
   - **Result**: 0.15% error rate, average latency 8.7ms

3. **Stress Test**:
   - **Rate**: 250,000 requests/second
   - **Duration**: 2 minutes
   - **Result**: 1.2% error rate, average latency 23ms

### Resource Utilization

#### CPU Usage
- **Idle**: 0.5-2%
- **Under Load (50k RPS)**: 35-45%
- **Peak Load (150k RPS)**: 75-85%

#### Memory Usage
- **Baseline**: 1.2GB
- **Under Load (50k RPS)**: 2.8GB
- **Peak Load (150k RPS)**: 4.2GB

## Accuracy Assessment

### Geolocation Accuracy

We evaluated the system's geolocation accuracy using a dataset of 1,000,000 known IP addresses with verified locations:

| Location Granularity | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Country | 99.8% |
| Region (State/Province) | 98.2% |
| City | 94.7% |
| Postal Code | 82.3% |

### Threat Detection Rates

| Threat Type | Detection Rate | False Positive Rate |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| VPN | 98.5% | 0.3% |
| Proxy | 97.2% | 0.5% |
| TOR Exit Node | 99.1% | 0.1% |
| Malicious IP | 96.8% | 0.4% |

### False Positive/Negative Analysis

#### Common Causes of False Positives
1. Corporate networks with VPN-like characteristics
2. Mobile carrier networks with shared IP addresses
3. Cloud hosting providers with mixed-usage IP ranges

#### Common Causes of False Negatives
1. Newly allocated IP ranges not yet in the database
2. Residential VPN services that blend in with normal traffic
3. Sophisticated proxy services that actively evade detection

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Dependency on External Data Sources**: Accuracy is tied to third-party IP databases
2. **Limited Behavioral Analysis**: Currently focuses on IP-based analysis
3. **Resource Intensive**: High memory requirements for in-memory data structures

### Planned Improvements
1. **Enhanced Behavioral Analysis**:
   - User agent analysis
   - Browser fingerprinting
   - Mouse and keyboard dynamics

2. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Anomaly detection
   - Predictive threat scoring
   - Adaptive learning of new threat patterns

3. **Expanded Data Sources**:
   - Additional threat intelligence feeds
   - Crowdsourced threat reporting
   - Integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems
